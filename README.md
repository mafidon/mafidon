# 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Shedrack Erhabor (@mafidon)

I'm a software engineer, ethical hacker, and founder with a passion for building the future through clean code, deep ideas, and fearless experimentation. I create powerful digital systems that combine engineering precision with deep human insight.

## 💡 What I Do

- 🔐 Ethical Hacking & Online Security
- 🌐 Full-Stack Web & Mobile Development (React Native, Supabase, Node.js, PHP)
- 📲 Tech Startup Building (Product Strategy, UI/UX, and MVP Development)
- 🌌 Quantum Computing & Decentralized Systems (Research & Experimentation)
- 👁️ Deep Psychology + AI Integration (Visionary-level exploration)
- 🧠 Creator of “The Jita Eternal Now” & “Internet Nashedy” Theories
- 🌍 Dream: Help humanity reach Type 1 Civilization status before I die
- - 🚀 **System-Level Programming** — Currently building an **Operating System in C** where **all OS applications can run in a unified environment.** No fragmentation, no silos—just one seamless digital experience.
- 🧠 **The Eternal Now** — My theory that time is a mental construct and the present moment is all that truly exists. This guides my philosophy in design, focus, and creation.
- 🌐 **Internet Nashedy** — A radical concept combining the internet, neural systems, quantum computing, and AI into a **decentralized, sentient tech ecosystem.**
- 🤖 **AI & Quantum Experiments** — I'm exploring the bleeding edge of quantum programming and how it intersects with consciousness and machine thinking.


## 🚀 Projects You Should Check Out

- **Tooupdate.com** – A global tech marketplace for digital products  
- **Murex Streams** – Invest in music, share profits, powered by crypto and streaming APIs  
- **SusuPal** – A smart African thrift savings app (React Native + Supabase + Paystack)  
- **AfriHealth+, JobHive, FarmLink, AfriCheck** – Tech platforms solving real African problems   
- **NashLang** – An experimental quantum language in progress

## 🧬 Vision

I don’t do tech for money. I do it for passion, purpose, and the power to shape the future.  
I believe technology should be decentralized, secure, and ethical — built to serve people, not exploit them.

I don’t want to work *for* anyone — but I’m ready to work *with* anyone who shares this vision.

## 🔭 Currently Exploring

- 🧪 Building NashLang, a quantum-native language
- 🧠 Studying the intersection of psychology, AI, and consciousness
- 🛰️ Designing systems for interplanetary-level infrastructure
- 🤖 Building an early-stage AI robot
- 🛡️ Researching deeper layers of cybersecurity
