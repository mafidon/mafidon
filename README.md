# 👋🏽 Hey, I’m Shedrack Erhabor (@mafidon)

I’m a software developer, ethical hacker, quantum computing explorer, and founder of several tech startups including [Tooupdate.com](https://tooupdate.com) and [Murex Streams](https://murexstreams.com). I build powerful digital systems that combine engineering precision with deep human insight.

## 💡 What I Do

- 🔐 Ethical Hacking & Online Security
- 🌐 Full-Stack Web & Mobile Development (React Native, Supabase, Node.js, PHP)
- 📲 Tech Startup Building (Product Strategy, UI/UX, and MVP Development)
- 🌌 Quantum Computing & Decentralized Systems (Research & Experimentation)
- 👁️ Deep Psychology + AI Integration (Visionary-level exploration)
- 🧠 Creator of “The Jita Eternal Now” & “Internet Nashedy” Theories
- 🌍 Dream: Help humanity reach Type 1 Civilization status before I die

## 🚀 Projects You Should Check Out

- **Tooupdate.com** – A global tech marketplace for digital products  
- **Murex Streams** – Invest in music, share profits, powered by crypto and streaming APIs  
- **SusuPal** – A smart African thrift savings app (React Native + Supabase + Paystack)  
- **AfriHealth+, JobHive, FarmLink, AfriCheck** – Tech platforms solving real African problems  
- **Tayler Holder Token (TH)** – Meme token on Solana with staking, swaps, and airdrops  
- **NashLang** – An experimental quantum language in progress

## 🧬 Vision

I don’t do tech for money. I do it for passion, purpose, and the power to shape the future.  
I believe technology should be decentralized, secure, and ethical — built to serve people, not exploit them.

I don’t want to work *for* anyone — but I’m ready to work *with* anyone who shares this vision.

## 🔭 Currently Exploring

- 🧪 Building NashLang, a quantum-native language
- 🧠 Studying the intersection of psychology, AI, and consciousness
